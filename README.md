TMK Parking App is a web application built using Ruby on Rails that aims to simplify parking management for both parking lot owners and customers. The app provides an easy-to-use interface for users to find available parking spots, book them in advance, and manage their parking reservations.

## Features

- Parking Spot Listing: Parking lot owners can list their available parking spots, including details like location, price, and availability.
- Booking System: Customers can search for available parking spots, book them for specific dates and times, and make payments.
- User Dashboard: Each user has a personalized dashboard that displays their bookings, reservations, and account information.
- Ratings and Reviews: Customers can leave ratings and reviews for parking spots they have used, helping others make informed decisions.
- Admin Panel: An admin panel allows administrators to manage users, parking spots, and reservations effectively.
- Notifications: Users receive notifications for booking confirmations, cancellations, and other important updates.
